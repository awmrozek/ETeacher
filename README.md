ETeacher for Datorer i System
=============================

This is a demonstration routine written for Datorer i System course at LTH. The code is an extract of a larger project developed by Adam Mrozek as well. The problem with the large piece of code is that it is not very well written, nor well documented and therefore not suitable to post on the Internet.

Source Code Structure
---------------------

This program consists of two source files. The first one, [[Eteacher]] provides a nice user interface to interact with, and the second one [[DbTeacher]] implements the code required to interact with an Internet database.

This program demonstrates the use of the Internet in teaching the fascinating subject of Mathematics. There are many ways in which the program may be developed, for instance, by adding a nice GUI or adding LATEX support to render mathematical formulas.
